# LatteReview Streamlit GUI - Development Status

This document summarizes the development status of the LatteReview Streamlit GUI () based on the features outlined in .

## Overview

The Streamlit GUI provides a user interface for managing literature review projects, configuring multi-round/multi-agent review workflows, executing these workflows (by interfacing with the  Python package), and analyzing the results.

All features from the initial TODO list (Parts 1 and 2) have been implemented within . The level of integration with a "live" backend varies per feature, as detailed below.

## Feature Status Summary

### Part 1: GUI Development Plan
*   **Sections 1.0 - 2.2 (Basic Structure, Project Management, Data Import & Preview):**
    *   Status:
    *   Details: UI for project creation (folder-based), RIS file upload, parsing (using ), and data preview is implemented.
*   **Sections 3.0 - 4.4 (Workflow Configuration, Review Execution, Results Presentation & Export):**
    *   Status:
    *   Details:
        *   Comprehensive UI for defining multi-round workflows with multiple agents per round, including agent types, personas, criteria, and inter-round filtering logic.
        *   The "Start Actual Review" button now constructs a  object from the  package using the GUI configuration and calls its execution method ().
        *   The application processes the DataFrame returned by the  backend to derive summary columns (e.g., , ) and a consolidated  for UI display.
        *   UI includes results overview with filters, a detailed view for selected articles, and CSV export of results.
        *   LLM calls made by the  backend are dependent on valid API key provision and LiteLLM's configuration (may use fallback/dummy LLMs if not fully configured).

### Part 2: New Feature Expansion Plan
*   **5.1 Theme Concept Extraction & Visualization:**
    *   Status:
    *   Details: The Theme Analysis Dashboard processes output columns from  instances (e.g., ) in the results from the  backend. It displays concept frequencies and a word cloud. The network graph remains a placeholder.
*   **5.2 Reviewer Debate Workflow:**
    *   Status:
    *   Details: The GUI *simulates* a debate round in the  if configured agents in a round show disagreement. This includes simulated peer feedback and re-evaluation. A true backend debate mechanism would require changes to the  package itself.
*   **5.3 RAG-Enhanced Review:**
    *   Status:
    *   Details: UI allows uploading PDF/TXT background documents. Text is extracted from these. The  (generated by simulating the  execution trace) includes entries indicating that this RAG context (e.g., keyword-based snippets from uploaded docs) was considered by agents. The actual injection and use of this context by LLMs would occur within the  agents/prompts if they are designed to support it.

### General Tasks / Documentation
*   **G1: Internationalize UI and documentation to English:**
    *   Status:
    *   Details: , , and user-facing UI text and code comments in  have been translated/written in English.

## Next Steps / Considerations

*   **True End-to-End LLM Calls:** Thoroughly testing with valid API keys for  (or other models configured in ) to ensure seamless operation with live LLMs.
*   **Robust Filter Logic for Workflows:** The translation of GUI-defined inter-round filters into the  schema's  parameter (which expects specific string formats or callables) is currently basic. This may need refinement for complex filtering scenarios.
*   **Error Handling & UX:** Further enhancements to error handling for backend calls and general UX improvements (e.g., persistent workflow saving/loading, more granular progress for actual reviews if possible).
*   **Completing Placeholders:** Implementing the Concept Network Graph (TODO 5.1 C) and the actual RIS export (TODO 4.4).
*   **Backend  Enhancements:** Features like a true Reviewer Debate mechanism or deeper RAG integration would require modifications to the core  Python package.

This GUI provides a solid foundation for interacting with the  literature review automation engine.
